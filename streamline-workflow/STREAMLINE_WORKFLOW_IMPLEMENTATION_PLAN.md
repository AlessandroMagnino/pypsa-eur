# PyPSA-EUR Workflow Streamlining Implementation Plan

**Reference**: GitHub Discussion #1529  
**Objective**: Refactor PyPSA-EUR from complex wildcard-driven workflow to unified 4-step structure: `base ‚Üí clustered ‚Üí composed ‚Üí solved`

## üìã Executive Summary

This plan implements the proposal from discussion #1529 to harmonize electricity-only and sector-coupled workflows, eliminate most wildcards in favor of config-driven approach, and reduce workflow complexity while maintaining all functionality.

### Core Design Principles
- **Additive approach**: Keep existing scripts, import functions, combine main sections in new compose script
- **No backward compatibility needed**: Clean break from current approach
- **Config-driven**: Move from wildcards to configuration for file targeting
- **Unified workflows**: Same approach for electricity-only and sector-coupled

## üéØ Status Update (August 2025)

**‚úÖ PROOF OF CONCEPT COMPLETED**  
**‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS WITH ISSUES**

The streamlined workflow concept has been successfully tested via `rules/test_streamlined.smk`, but the production implementation in `rules/compose.smk` currently has syntax errors that need resolution.

### Current Implementation Status
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **4-Step Workflow** | ‚úÖ Tested | `base ‚Üí clustered ‚Üí composed_{horizon} ‚Üí solved_{horizon}` |
| **Config-Driven Approach** | ‚úÖ Tested | No wildcard expansion, `temporal` section replaces `scenario` |
| **Multi-Foresight Support** | ‚úÖ Tested | Overnight, Myopic, Perfect foresight modes validated |
| **Test Implementation** | ‚úÖ Working | `rules/test_streamlined.smk` functional |
| **Production Rules** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Broken | `rules/compose.smk` has syntax errors (line 54-57, 161) |
| **Compose Script** | ‚úÖ Exists | `scripts/compose_network.py` (23KB) implemented |
| **Test Configs** | ‚úÖ Complete | Both original and streamlined configs exist |

### Existing Files and Artifacts
#### Test Implementation (Working)
- **`rules/test_streamlined.smk`**: Complete test workflow (204 lines)
- **`config/test/config.overnight.yaml`**: Original test config
- **`config/test/config.myopic.yaml`**: Original test config
- **`config/test/config.perfect.yaml`**: Original test config

#### Production Implementation (In Progress)  
- **`rules/compose.smk`**: Production rules (10KB) - **HAS SYNTAX ERRORS**
- **`scripts/compose_network.py`**: Main composition script (23KB) - Implemented
- **`config/test/config.streamlined-overnight.yaml`**: Streamlined config
- **`config/test/config.streamlined-myopic.yaml`**: Streamlined config  
- **`config/test/config.streamlined-perfect.yaml`**: Streamlined config

### Critical Issues Fixed (August 16, 2025)
1. **‚úÖ FIXED: Syntax Error in `compose.smk`**: Dict construction mixing positional/keyword args
   - Restructured to use `inputs.update()` pattern for proper merging
2. **‚úÖ FIXED: Duplicate Rule Names**: 
   - `build_population_layouts` ‚Üí `build_clustered_population_layouts`
   - `build_co2_sequestration_potentials` ‚Üí `build_clustered_co2_sequestration_potentials`
3. **‚úÖ FIXED: Missing Rule File**: Changed `solve_electricity.smk` ‚Üí `solve.smk` in Snakefile
4. **‚úÖ FIXED: Wildcard Consistency**: Fixed log/benchmark wildcards in postprocess.smk rules

### Key Learnings from Testing
1. **Horizon handling needs flexibility**: Single values vs lists require helper functions
2. **Config robustness essential**: Missing sections cause workflow failures 
3. **Sequential dependencies work**: Myopic and perfect foresight DAGs validated
4. **Rule structure scales**: Same rules work across all foresight modes
5. **Lambda functions required**: Dynamic horizon resolution needs runtime evaluation

## üéØ Target Architecture

### New 4-Step Workflow
```
1. base       ‚Üí networks/{run}/base.nc
2. clustered  ‚Üí networks/{run}/clustered.nc  
3. composed   ‚Üí networks/{run}/composed_{horizon}.nc
4. solved     ‚Üí networks/{run}/solved_{horizon}.nc (last horizon = final result)
```

### Current vs Target File Naming
```
CURRENT:  networks/base_s_{clusters}_{opts}_{sector_opts}_{planning_horizons}.nc
TARGET:   networks/{run}/solved_{last_horizon}.nc
```

All configuration (clusters, opts, sector_opts, horizons) moves from wildcards to scenario config.

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Wildcard Usage Mapping
- `{clusters}`: 37, 128, 256, etc. ‚Üí `config.clustering.cluster_network.n_clusters`
- `{opts}`: electricity constraints ‚Üí `config.electricity.extendable_carriers`, etc.
- `{sector_opts}`: sector settings ‚Üí `config.sector.*`  
- `{planning_horizons}`: 2030, 2050 ‚Üí `config.temporal.planning_horizons`

### Key Scripts Dependencies
| Script | Main Functions | Snakemake Dependencies |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| `add_electricity.py` | `attach_load()`, `attach_wind_and_solar()`, `attach_storageunits()` | base_network, tech_costs, powerplants |
| `prepare_sector_network.py` | `add_heat()`, `add_transport()`, `add_industry()` | elec network, industrial demand, heat demand |
| `add_existing_baseyear.py` | `add_power_capacities_installed_before_baseyear()` | network, powerplants, heating data |
| `prepare_network.py` | `average_every_nhours()`, `add_co2limit()` | clustered network, tech costs |
| `cluster_network.py` | `busmap_for_n_clusters()`, `clustering_for_n_clusters()` | simplified network, admin shapes |
| `simplify_network.py` | `simplify_network_to_380()`, `remove_stubs()` | base network, admin shapes |

## üîß Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### 1.1 Create New Scripts
```bash
scripts/compose_network.py     # Main composition orchestrator
rules/compose.smk             # New workflow rules
# Modify existing scripts/solve_network.py for unified approach
```

#### 1.2 Configuration Schema Updates
```yaml
# Remove scenario section entirely (no more wildcards!)
# scenario:  # REMOVED - no more wildcard expansion

# Add new temporal section for planning settings
temporal:
  planning_horizons: [2030, 2040, 2050]
  foresight: "myopic"  # or "perfect", "overnight"

# Everything else uses existing config sections directly:
# - clustering.cluster_network.n_clusters (was {clusters})
# - electricity.* settings (was {opts})
# - sector.* settings (was {sector_opts})
```

#### 1.2.1 Validated Configuration Pattern (from Testing)
Based on our testing, the following configuration structure has been validated:

```yaml
# Required: Run identification for file paths
run:
  name: "test-sector-overnight"  # Maps to {run} wildcard

# Required: Temporal planning configuration  
temporal:
  foresight: overnight  # or "myopic", "perfect"
  planning_horizons: 2040  # Single value OR [2030, 2040, 2050] list

# Required: Clustering configuration with explicit n_clusters
clustering:
  temporal:
    resolution_sector: 24h
  cluster_network:
    algorithm: kmeans
    n_clusters: 5  # Small number for testing
    hac_features:
    - wnd100m
    - influx_direct

# Existing sections work as-is (electricity, sector, solving, etc.)
```

**Key Testing Insights:**
- `planning_horizons` must handle both single values and lists flexibly
- `cluster_network.n_clusters` is required (was previously derived from wildcard)
- Missing config sections need graceful defaults using `.get()` methods
- `run.name` provides the directory structure for organized outputs

#### 1.3 New Workflow Rules Structure
```python
# rules/compose.smk
rule cluster_network:
    input: "networks/{run}/base.nc"
    output: "networks/{run}/clustered.nc"
    script: "../scripts/cluster_network.py"  # Use existing script with modifications

rule compose_network:
    input: unpack(get_compose_inputs)  # Dynamic inputs based on horizon
    output: "networks/{run}/composed_{horizon}.nc"
    script: "../scripts/compose_network.py"

rule solve_network:
    input: "networks/{run}/composed_{horizon}.nc"
    output: "networks/{run}/solved_{horizon}.nc"
    script: "../scripts/solve_network.py"
```

#### 1.4 Validated Implementation Patterns (from Testing)

**Dynamic Input Resolution:**
```python
def get_compose_inputs(wildcards):
    """Determine inputs for compose rule based on foresight and horizon."""
    temporal = config["temporal"]
    foresight = temporal["foresight"]
    horizon = int(wildcards.horizon)
    
    # Handle both single value and list for planning_horizons
    planning_horizons = temporal["planning_horizons"]
    if isinstance(planning_horizons, (int, str)):
        horizons = [int(planning_horizons)]
    else:
        horizons = [int(h) for h in planning_horizons]

    inputs = {"clustered": f"networks/{wildcards.run}/clustered.nc"}

    if horizon != horizons[0]:
        # Not first horizon - need previous network
        prev_horizon = horizons[horizons.index(horizon) - 1]

        if foresight == "myopic":
            # Myopic uses solved network from previous horizon
            inputs["network_previous"] = (
                f"networks/{wildcards.run}/solved_{prev_horizon}.nc"
            )
        else:  # perfect foresight
            # Perfect foresight uses composed network from previous horizon
            inputs["network_previous"] = (
                f"networks/{wildcards.run}/composed_{prev_horizon}.nc"
            )

    return inputs
```

**Strict Parameter Handling:**
```python
# In rule params use the config_handler function 
params:
    temporal=config_handler("temporal"),
    electricity=config_handler("electricity"),
    sector=config_handler("sector"),
    clustering=config_handler("clustering"),
    another_key=config_handler("electricity", "another_key"),
```

**Dynamic Horizon Resolution:**
```python
def get_final_horizon():
    """Get the final planning horizon, handling both single values and lists."""
    planning_horizons = config["temporal"]["planning_horizons"]
    if isinstance(planning_horizons, (int, str)):
        return int(planning_horizons)
    else:
        return int(planning_horizons[-1])

# Use in lambda functions for rule inputs
rule test_overnight:
    input:
        lambda w: f"networks/test-overnight/solved_{get_final_horizon()}.nc",
```

### Phase 2: Compose Network Implementation

#### 2.1 `scripts/compose_network.py` Structure

#### 2.2 Multi-Horizon DAG Design

Based on FabianHofmann's comment, implement different workflows:

**Overnight Workflow**:
```
compose_{horizon} ‚Üí solve_{horizon} ‚Üí solved.nc
```
- Single horizon (e.g., 2050)
- Direct optimization of composed network
- Final output is copy of single horizon result

**Myopic Workflow**:
```
compose_2030 (input: clustered) ‚Üí solve_2030 ‚Üí compose_2040 (input: solved_2030) ‚Üí solve_2040 ‚Üí ...
```
- Each horizon is composed with brownfield constraints from previous solved network
- Each horizon is solved independently
- Final output contains last horizon's solved network

**Perfect Foresight Workflow**:
```
compose_2030 ‚Üí compose_2040 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí compose_2050 ‚Üí solve_2050 (all horizons)
```
- Each horizon is composed and concatenated with previous composed networks
- Only the last horizon's solve rule runs (solves all horizons together)
- Earlier horizons are never individually solved (not needed since solve_X files aren't requested)
- Final output contains all horizons in multi-period network

**Key Differences**:
| Aspect | Myopic | Perfect Foresight |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Input to compose | Previous solved network | Previous composed network |
| Brownfield logic | Applied in compose step | Not needed (all horizons optimized together) |
| Network structure | Single horizon per file | Multi-horizon concatenated |
| Solving | Each horizon separately (simple optimization) | All horizons together |
| Output | Sequential solved networks | Single multi-period network |

#### 2.3 `rules/compose.smk` Unified Rules with Horizon Wildcard
```python
def get_compose_inputs(wildcards):
    """Determine inputs for compose rule based on foresight and horizon."""
    config = get_config()
    temporal = config["temporal"]
    foresight = temporal["foresight"]
    horizon = int(wildcards.horizon)
    horizons = temporal["planning_horizons"]
    
    inputs = {"clustered": f"networks/{wildcards.run}/clustered.nc"}
    
    if horizon != horizons[0]:
        # Not first horizon - need previous network
        prev_horizon = horizons[horizons.index(horizon) - 1]
        
        if foresight == "myopic":
            # Myopic uses solved network from previous horizon
            inputs["network_previous"] = f"networks/{wildcards.run}/solved_{prev_horizon}.nc"
        else:  # perfect foresight
            # Perfect foresight uses composed network from previous horizon
            inputs["network_previous"] = f"networks/{wildcards.run}/composed_{prev_horizon}.nc"
    
    # Add other required inputs using resource functions with {run} paths
    inputs.update({
        "tech_costs": resources("costs_{horizon}.csv"),
        "powerplants": resources("powerplants.csv"),
        "load": resources("electricity_demand.csv"),
        "busmap": resources("busmap.csv"),
        "profile_solar": resources("profile_{run}/solar.nc"),
        "profile_onwind": resources("profile_{run}/onwind.nc"),
        # ... other inputs as needed, some with {horizon} wildcard
    })
    
    return inputs

rule compose_network:
    input: unpack(get_compose_inputs)
    output: "networks/{run}/composed_{horizon}.nc"
    params:
        temporal=config["temporal"],
        electricity=config["electricity"],
        sector=config["sector"],
        clustering=config["clustering"],
        existing_capacities=config["existing_capacities"],
        # Cherry-pick other config sections as needed
    script: "../scripts/compose_network.py"

rule solve_network:
    input: "networks/{run}/composed_{horizon}.nc"
    output: "networks/{run}/solved_{horizon}.nc"
    params:
        temporal=config["temporal"],
        solver=config["solving"]["solver"]
    script: "../scripts/solve_network.py"

# No solve_final rule needed! 
# For perfect foresight: solve_{last_horizon} takes composed_{last_horizon} (all horizons) and solves once
# For myopic/overnight: solve_{last_horizon} is the natural final result
```

### Phase 3: Solving Integration

#### 3.1 Simplified Solving Script
```python
# scripts/solve_network.py (modify existing script)
"""Simplified unified solving for all foresight approaches."""

def main():
    """Main solving logic - simplified for all cases."""
    # Load network
    network = pypsa.Network(snakemake.input[0])
    
    # Get config and params
    config = snakemake.config
    params = snakemake.params
    
    # Prepare solver options
    solver_options = params.solver
    solver_name = solver_options["solver_name"]
    
    # Determine if we need to pass snapshots (for myopic only)
    temporal = params.temporal
    foresight = temporal["foresight"]
    current_horizon = int(snakemake.wildcards.horizon)
    
    if foresight == "myopic":
        # For myopic: solve only current horizon's snapshots
        snapshots = network.snapshots[network.snapshots.get_level_values("period") == current_horizon]
        status, condition = network.optimize(
            solver_name=solver_name,
            solver_options=solver_options,
            snapshots=snapshots
        )
    else:
        # For overnight and perfect foresight: solve all snapshots
        status, condition = network.optimize(
            solver_name=solver_name,
            solver_options=solver_options
        )
    
    # Check optimization status
    if status != "ok":
        logger.warning(f"Optimization failed with status {status}")
    
    # Export solved network
    network.export_to_netcdf(snakemake.output[0])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

#### 4.1 Rule Dependencies Update
```python
# Update rules/collect.smk with new targets
rule solve_networks:
    input:
        lambda w: expand(
            "networks/{run}/solved_{horizon}.nc",
            run=config["run"]["name"],  # Note: run.name can be a list
            horizon=config["temporal"]["planning_horizons"][-1]
        )

rule prepare_networks:
    input: 
        lambda w: expand(
            "networks/{run}/composed_{horizon}.nc",
            run=config["run"]["name"],  # Note: run.name can be a list
            horizon=config["temporal"]["planning_horizons"][-1]
        )

rule cluster_networks:
    input:
        expand(
            "networks/{run}/clustered.nc",
            run=config["run"]["name"]  # Note: run.name can be a list
        )
```

#### 4.2 Configuration Migration
- Remove `scenario` section entirely (no wildcard expansion)
- Add new `temporal` section for planning horizons and foresight
- Use existing config sections directly (clustering, electricity, sector)
- No migration script needed - clean break from wildcards

#### 4.3 Testing Strategy
```bash
# Basic workflow validation
snakemake cluster_networks -n  # Dry run clustering step
snakemake prepare_networks -n  # Dry run compose step
snakemake solve_networks -n    # Dry run solve step

# Test each foresight mode specifically
snakemake networks/test-run/solved_2050.nc -n  # Overnight mode
snakemake networks/test-myopic/solved_2050.nc -n  # Myopic mode  
snakemake networks/test-perfect/solved_2050.nc -n  # Perfect foresight mode

# Validate results match current workflow  
python scripts/validate_results.py \
  --old networks/base_s_128_Co2L-3H_sector.nc \
  --new networks/{run}/solved_{last_horizon}.nc

# Test horizon-specific input handling
snakemake networks/test-run/composed_2030.nc -n  # First horizon
snakemake networks/test-run/composed_2040.nc -n  # Middle horizon
snakemake networks/test-run/composed_2050.nc -n  # Last horizon
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 1: Script Implementation (CURRENT - NEEDS FIXES)
- [x] ~~Create `scripts/compose_network.py` based on validated test framework~~ **DONE**
- [x] ~~Import and integrate functions from existing scripts~~ **DONE**

- [ ] Implement network concatenation for perfect foresight
- [ ] Add brownfield logic for myopic optimization  
- [ ] Test with real input data and actual script execution
- [ ] Verify integration with existing rule dependencies

### Phase 2: Integration & Production (BLOCKED BY PHASE 1)

- [ ] Create collection rules (`solve_networks`, `prepare_networks`)
- [ ] Migrate configuration templates and examples
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with full scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization and memory management
- [ ] Resolve conflicts with existing workflow rules

### Phase 3: Documentation & Migration
- [ ] Update user documentation with new workflow approach
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing users
- [ ] Add configuration validation and helpful error messages
- [ ] Community feedback and iteration

## üö® Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Syntax Errors in `compose.smk`
The dict construction in `get_compose_inputs()` has mixed positional and keyword arguments:
```python
# BROKEN: Lines 54-57
inputs = dict(
    unpack(input_profile_tech),  # OK - positional at start
    base_network=resources("..."),  # Keyword args
    # ...
    unpack(input_profile_offwind),  # ERROR: positional after keyword
    unpack(input_heat_source_power),  # ERROR: positional after keyword
    **rules.cluster_gas_network.output,  # Should use proper syntax
)
```

**Solution**: Move all unpacked/positional arguments to the beginning or use `.update()` method.

### 2. Verify Rule Dependencies
- Check if `cluster_gas_network` and `build_gas_input_locations` rules exist
- Ensure all referenced input functions (`input_profile_tech`, etc.) are defined
- Validate that `config_provider` and `resources` functions work correctly

### 3. Test Workflow Execution
After fixing syntax errors:
```bash
# Test compose workflow with streamlined configs
snakemake -s rules/compose.smk networks/test-run/composed_2040.nc \
  --configfile config/test/config.streamlined-overnight.yaml -n

# Verify all foresight modes
for mode in overnight myopic perfect; do
  snakemake -s rules/compose.smk test_${mode} \
    --configfile config/test/config.streamlined-${mode}.yaml -n
done
```

### 4. Integration Considerations
- The workflow appears to have moved beyond the original plan with additional complexity
- Recent commits show "brute force rename paths" and "remove wildcards" indicating aggressive refactoring
- Need to ensure backward compatibility or clear migration path

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Proof of Concept Achievements (COMPLETED)
1. **‚úÖ Simplified Structure**: 4-step workflow with only `{run}` and `{horizon}` wildcards validated
2. **‚úÖ Config-Driven**: Target files determined by configuration, not wildcards - working
3. **‚úÖ Unified DAG**: Single rule structure works for overnight, myopic, and perfect foresight - tested
4. **‚úÖ Robust Parameter Handling**: Graceful defaults for missing config sections - implemented
5. **‚úÖ Multi-Foresight Support**: All three foresight modes working with correct dependencies

### üéØ Production Implementation Goals (NEXT)
1. **Functional Equivalence**: New workflow produces identical results to current workflow
2. **Unified Approach**: Same workflow handles electricity-only and sector-coupled
3. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns, reusable functions
4. **Performance**: Efficient memory usage and execution time
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages and configuration validation

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Large intermediate files**: Monitor disk usage, implement cleanup rules
- **Memory usage**: Test with largest scenarios, optimize data loading
- **Function compatibility**: Extensive unit testing of imported functions

### Process Risks  
- **Regression**: Comprehensive result validation pipeline
- **Timeline**: Start with minimal viable implementation, iterate
- **Coordination**: Regular check-ins, clear interfaces between components

---

## üîç Open Ends and Potential Issues

### üö© Current State Assessment
The implementation has diverged from the original plan with more aggressive changes than initially proposed:

1. **Scope Creep**: Recent commits show "brute force rename paths" suggesting more invasive changes than the additive approach originally planned
2. **Broken State**: Production rules have syntax errors preventing execution
3. **Incomplete Testing**: While test framework exists, actual execution with real data hasn't been validated
4. **Missing Integration**: No clear path from current broken state to working production

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt and Risks

#### Immediate Issues
- **Syntax Errors**: `compose.smk` cannot execute due to dict construction errors
- **Undefined References**: Rules reference `cluster_gas_network` and `build_gas_input_locations` - need verification
- **Path Inconsistencies**: Mix of old wildcard paths and new streamlined paths

#### Integration Challenges  
- **Parallel Development**: Main branch continues evolving while streamline-workflow diverges
- **Testing Gap**: No evidence of end-to-end execution with actual data
- **Config Migration**: Two sets of test configs (original vs streamlined) without clear relationship

#### Architecture Concerns
- **Aggressive Refactoring**: "Brute force" approach may have broken assumptions
- **Missing Backwards Compatibility**: No migration path for existing users
- **Unclear Dependencies**: Rule dependencies between compose and existing rules unclear

## üîç Open Questions for Discussion

### ‚úÖ Resolved Questions (from Testing)
1. **~~Rule Dependencies~~**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - Dynamic input functions with lambda expressions work perfectly
2. **~~Configuration Flexibility~~**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - Helper functions handle single values vs lists robustly  
3. **~~Foresight Mode Implementation~~**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - Single rule structure works for all modes
4. **~~Parameter Robustness~~**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - `.get()` methods with defaults prevent config errors

### ü§î Critical Unresolved Questions

1. **Network Concatenation Implementation**: What's the best approach for concatenating networks across horizons in PyPSA?
   - How to handle multi-indexed snapshots for perfect foresight?
   - How to merge components with horizon-specific attributes?
   - Should we use PyPSA's native multi-period capabilities or custom implementation?

2. **Input Data Handling**: How should time-varying input data be handled across horizons?
   - Renewable profiles for different years (weather data variability)
   - Demand projections and growth rates
   - Cost trajectories and technology learning curves
   - Should inputs be horizon-specific in file paths?

3. **Brownfield Implementation Details**: For myopic optimization:
   - Should all existing capacities be locked or allow decommissioning?
   - How to handle technology-specific lifetime constraints?
   - Interface between `add_brownfield` and composed network structure
   - How to transfer capacity constraints between horizons?

4. **Memory Management**: For perfect foresight with many horizons:
   - Expected memory usage for concatenated networks (3+ horizons)
   - Strategies for handling very large multi-period networks
   - Should we implement checkpointing between horizons?
   - Disk vs memory tradeoffs for intermediate files

5. **Production Integration**: How to integrate with existing workflow?
   - Should we add to main `Snakefile` or keep separate?
   - How to handle backward compatibility during transition?
   - Configuration migration strategy for existing users

6. **Backward Compatibility Bridge**: Although not required, should we provide:
   - Script to convert old wildcard-based configs to new format?
   - Mapping table for users to understand the transition?

## üìö Recommended Recovery Path

### Option 1: Fix and Continue (Recommended)

1. **Fix Syntax Errors**: Resolve dict construction issues in `compose.smk`
2. **Test Incrementally**: Start with the simplest case (overnight) before complex (myopic/perfect)
3. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all referenced rules and functions exist
4. **Document Changes**: Update this plan with actual implementation details
5. **Create Tests**: Add unit tests for compose_network.py functions

### Option 2: Revert to Test Implementation

1. **Use Working Test**: Start from `test_streamlined.smk` which is known to work
2. **Gradual Migration**: Move functionality piece by piece to production
3. **Maintain Stability**: Keep test and production separate until fully validated
4. **Incremental Integration**: Merge with main workflow only after full validation

### Option 3: Re-evaluate Approach

1. **Review Original Goals**: Ensure current implementation aligns with discussion #1529
2. **Consider Alternatives**: Less invasive approaches that maintain compatibility
3. **Phased Rollout**: Implement as optional alternative workflow first
4. **Community Input**: Get feedback before committing to breaking changes

## üéØ Priority Actions (Updated August 16, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Actions
1. **Fixed syntax errors** in compose.smk - dict construction restructured
2. **Fixed duplicate rule names** in build_sector.smk - renamed to clustered variants
3. **Fixed missing rule file** - corrected solve_electricity.smk to solve.smk
4. **Fixed wildcard consistency** in postprocess.smk

### üöß Remaining Actions
1. **SHORT-TERM**: Complete network concatenation for perfect foresight
2. **SHORT-TERM**: Implement brownfield logic for myopic optimization  
3. **MEDIUM-TERM**: Validate with real data (not just test configs)
